I\u2019m conflicted about work. If I didn\u2019t have to go to work I would cut all ties and move on, but I\u2019d be in the exact same position as I was before, so that\u2019s not an option.  \n\nI might have wasted the day but I ended it feeling much empowered. The more hope I have for my future, especially when it comes to dating, the less I think about Alice. I know I can get over this. I just need more options. \n",
